                <p>History of the NBA Draft -- The NBA Draft was first started all the way back in 1947, back when the 
                    league was known as the BAA and there was only 8 teams in the league. The draft consisted of 10 rounds, 
                    with 80 selections in total. Two years after that first draft, the BAA merged with the NBL to form the 
                    NBA that is still going strong today. In the NBA Draft, for players to be eligible they must be at least 
                    19 years old by the end of the calendar year and one year removed from high-school graduation. For a 
                    period of time, players were allowed to enter the draft immediately after high school, but that was 
                    ruled against following the 2005 season. While the first NBA draft was 10 rounds, since 1989 the draft 
                    has consisted of two rounds, with 30 picks in each round and 60 players selected in total.</p>
            
                <p>History of the WNBA Draft -- The first WNBA draft was much later than the first NBA draft, as it did 
                    not take place until 50 years later in 1997, when the league was first started. Unlike the NBA draft, 
                    the WNBA draft requires that all eligible participants must be 4 years removed from high school, 
                    meaning most draft prospects are not eligible until the graduate college. The 1997 draft was unique 
                    because it was comprised of 3 parts: an initial allocation of players into individual teams, then a 
                    WNBA elite draft which was designated for professionals coming from other leagues, and then 4 rounds 
                    of a regular draft for incoming players. Since 2003, the WNBA draft has only consisted of a three-round 
                    selection process with 12 picks in each round, so 36 players are selected in the draft each year.</p>
